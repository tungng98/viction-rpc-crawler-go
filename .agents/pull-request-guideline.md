# Pull Request Guideline

## Guideline

- Keep one logical change per pull request; split unrelated work into separate ones.
- Title the pull request with a short imperative summary of the change (e.g. `Add retry to the payment client`).
- Follow the repository's pull request template when it has one; otherwise write the description in these parts, writing "None" for an empty one:
  - Motivation: the problem or request, with linked issues/tickets.
  - Changes: what changed, grouped by intent.
  - Verification: the checks that ran, with their results; the checks that did not run, and why.
  - Breaking changes: every broken contract, and what its users must do.
  - Follow-ups: findings reported but not fixed.
