# Project Structure

Here are standard project structures of languages and frameworks, kept for reference.

The file holding the layout attuned to this project is [context.md](../.attunic/context.md).

The files holding the rules for working with this project are [coding-conventions.md](coding-conventions.md) and [development-guideline.md](development-guideline.md).

## General structure

### Layout

Entries a project commonly has at its root, whatever its languages; each layout below lists only what its language or framework adds:

```
├── .agents/            # shared AI agent instructions (coding conventions, PR/task checklists, project structure)
├── .attunic/           # project memory (context, confirmed facts, questions, work in progress)
├── .github/            # GitHub-specific config (workflows, issue/PR templates)
├── .vscode/            # VS Code editor/workspace settings
├── .copier-answers.yml # Copier answers replayed by `copier update`; never edited by hand
├── .editorconfig       # editor formatting rules
├── .gitignore          # git ignore patterns
├── AGENTS.md           # instructions for AI coding agents
├── CLAUDE.md           # points to AGENTS.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md     # contribution guidelines
├── COPYING             # license text for GPL, LGPL, and AGPL
├── COPYING.LESSER      # LGPL additions, beside COPYING
├── LICENSE             # license text for other licenses (e.g. MIT, Apache-2.0)
├── README.md           # project overview

```

## Go

### Go-Guideline

- Keep `main()` functions thin: parse flags/config, wire dependencies, then delegate to `internal/` packages.
- Code that should never be imported by other projects belongs under `internal/`.
- Only put code under `pkg/` if it's genuinely meant to be a public, importable API; don't use it as a dumping ground.
- Group files within a package by responsibility, not by type.
- Keep test files (`_test.go`) alongside the code they test, in the same package or a `_test` package for black-box tests.
- Mirror the module's existing layout (`internal/`, `pkg/`, or flat) instead of introducing a second convention.

### Go-Layer Dependencies

Notes for declaring architecture layers in the `Layer Dependencies` section of `.attunic/context.md`; adjust them to the project before declaring.

- `cmd/` is the outermost architecture layer: entrypoints parse flags/config, wire dependencies, then delegate to `internal/`; it may import everything, and nothing imports it.
- `internal/` holds the architecture layers themselves; one suggestion, innermost first:

| Architecture layer | Typical path | Depends on | Must never contain |
|--------------------|--------------|------------|--------------------|
| domain | internal/\<app\>/domain | itself | framework types, database, HTTP |
| application | internal/\<app\>/app | domain | database access, HTTP handlers |
| adapters | internal/\<app\>/adapters | application (its ports), domain | business rules |
| transport | internal/\<app\>/transport | application, domain | SQL, external clients |

- `pkg/` is a public boundary for other modules; keep application-internal architecture layer types out of it.
- Check by hand: reading imports or `go list -deps ./...` must never show an inner package importing an outer one.
