# Development Guideline

## Exploring

Reuse before writing new code; go through these in order and stop at the first that applies:

- Does it already exist in this codebase? Reuse the helper, util, or pattern that's already here; don't rewrite it.
- Does a closely matching implementation that needs adaptation exist in this codebase? Report it and propose extending it before writing anything new.
- Does the standard library already do this? Use it.
- Does a native platform feature cover it? Use it.
- Does an already-installed dependency solve it? Use it.
- Would a well-maintained new dependency solve it? Propose it with its name, version, and license before adding it; its license must be compatible with the project's.

## Writing

When writing code, follow these rules:

- Write the minimum that satisfies the task; never cut safety: validation, error handling, security, accessibility; see [Security](#security).
- Make targeted edits, never whole-file regeneration; every changed line must trace to the request.
- Keep one job per unit at every scale (function, type, module); if describing its job needs "and", split it. Parsing, domain rules, persistence, external calls, presentation, and wiring stay in separate homes.
- Find every usage of a symbol, config key, route, or file you change, by text search as well as code references, including tests and docs; make sure a signature or behavior change doesn't introduce a new bug or leave a bug half-fixed.
- Report unrelated findings instead of fixing them.
- Remove what your change orphaned (unused code, imports, tests, files).
- Update the docs that describe changed behavior (README, API docs, examples) in the same change.
- Treat public APIs, config keys, CLI flags, and persisted data formats as contracts; ask before breaking one, and call out the break.
- Never silence a linter, type checker, compiler warning, or test to get a clean run; fix the cause, or add a narrowly scoped suppression with a *why* comment.
- Never hand-edit generated files or lockfiles; change their source or use the tool that owns them, then regenerate.

## Security

When writing code or verifying changes, follow these rules:

- Keep authorization checks beside the operation they protect, or centralized in one enforced policy layer.
- Perform input validation at trust boundaries. Boundaries are external APIs, databases, file systems, clocks, queues, UI events, network calls, subprocesses, generated code.
- Grant least privilege: the narrowest permissions, token scopes, file modes, and network exposure that work.
- Use the standard library or a well-maintained, established library for auth and crypto.
- Prefer the standard library or a well-maintained, established library for parsing and serialization.
- Prefer allowlists over denylists when validating input, permissions, and file types.
- Never build queries, shell commands, markup, or code by concatenating untrusted input; use parameterized queries, argument lists, and context-aware escaping.
- Never log secrets, tokens, and sensitive data in error messages and logs.
- Never hardcode secrets or commit them to the repository; read them from the environment or a secret store.

## Fixing

When fixing issues, follow these rules:

- Fix the root cause, not just the symptom.
- Write a test that reproduces the bug first, watch it fail, then make it pass.
- Search for the same defect elsewhere and report other occurrences; fix them only when the task covers them.
<!-- Project-specific / Fixing -->

## Refactoring

When restructuring code without changing its behavior, follow these rules:

- Run the relevant tests before and after; behavior must not change.
- For deduplication, only merge true duplication (copies that must always change together, owned by the same actor); merging accidental lookalikes is harder to undo than leaving them apart.
- Run audit or cleanup work spanning more than one batch as a workstream: once the user consents to it, create `workstream.md` from [memory-template.md](memory-template.md), record the baseline before the first change, keep one intent per batch, verify after each batch, and keep `workstream.md` current.
<!-- Project-specific / Refactoring -->

## Testing

With a test harness, follow these rules when writing and running tests:

- Write one concept per test; split a test whose name needs "and"; prefer behavior-focused names.
- Write at least three deterministic expectations for each changed behavior, spread across tests as needed, and make sure at least one fails against the unchanged code.
- Cover boundaries and failure paths (empty, null, limits, invalid input, errors), not just the happy path.
- Keep arrange, act, and assert visibly distinct through code structure, not comments.
- Keep results deterministic: no sleeps or timing guesses; unit tests make no real network, filesystem, or clock call, and integration tests use only isolated, disposable resources (temp directories, local containers).
- Keep tests independent: each test sets up its own state and passes alone or in any order; never rely on another test's leftovers or on shared mutable state.
- Keep unit tests fast enough to run after every change; slow work belongs in integration tests.
- Assert on outcomes, not implementation.
- Treat a flaky test as a bug to fix; never rerun it until it passes.
- Treat a test that already failed before your change as a known failure only once the user confirms it.
- Never weaken, skip, or delete failing tests: restore the test, fix the code, or report the conflict and stop.

## Common Mistakes

Check your diff against these failure patterns; each must be fixed before completion:

- Hallucinated API: a function, method, option, or config key not in this codebase or the installed version => verify at the installed version, replace or remove.
- Unverified dependency: a new package or import without checking its registry name, version, license, or whether an installed dependency does the job => confirm the exact name/version (an invented name may be attacker-registered) and that its license is compatible with the project's; prefer what is installed.
- Context loss: a stale or partial read that contradicts existing code, restores deleted code, or drops error handling in a rewrite => re-read target files, callers, tests.
- Scope creep: changed lines that trace to no request such as drive-by renames, reformatting, dependency bumps => revert them and report instead.
- Duplicated implementation: a helper or sibling variant paralleling one that exists => search before writing, extend the original, merge only true duplication, never code owned by different actors.
- Wrong-file gravity: logic added to whatever file was open, a god file growing, a new file at the repository root or current directory => place by role per [context.md's Layout](../.attunic/context.md#layout), falling back to [project-structure.md](project-structure.md).
- Phantom success: "should work now" with nothing run; a stub, pass, placeholder, or demo value presented as done => run the check and quote the result, name what did not run, and state plainly what remains.
- Test weakening: an assertion loosened; a test skipped, deleted, or rewritten to match the bug, a snapshot re-accepted unread => restore the test and fix the code, or report the conflict and stop.
- Silent architecture drift: a new import cycle; or, when [context.md's Layer Dependencies](../.attunic/context.md#layer-dependencies) declares architecture layers, an import against the declared direction, a skipped architecture layer, or an ORM, framework, or HTTP type in a business rule, unless listed in its [Deliberate Exceptions](../.attunic/context.md#deliberate-exceptions) => break the cycle, check every changed file's imports against the table, keep framework types at the boundary.
- Missing validation: an input from a trust boundary accepted unchecked, including empty, null, or boundary values => validate at the boundary where the data enters.
- Missing error handling: a failing path swallowed or ignored, such as an unchecked error or an empty catch => handle it, wrap it, or propagate it explicitly.
- Silenced diagnostic: a lint, type-check, or compiler suppression or a disabled rule added to get a clean run => fix the cause, or scope the suppression narrowly with a *why* comment.
- Edited generated file: a hand edit to generated output or a lockfile => revert it, change the source, and regenerate.
- Stale docs: docs, examples, or comments still describing the old behavior => update them in the same change.
- Padded prose: filler or meaningless words in comments or docs, or a sentence restating the one before it => cut them.
- Unannounced breaking change: a public API, config key, CLI flag, or persisted data format changed without the user's agreement => restore compatibility or ask, then call out the break.

### Go-Testing

- Write table-driven tests with `t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {...})`; name each case for behavior, not the input shape.
- Call `t.Helper()` in every test helper so a failure reports the caller's line.
- Run with `-race` whenever a test touches a goroutine or shared state; a flake there is a bug to fix, not noise to rerun.
- Reach for `t.Parallel()` only once a test's fixtures are verified independent of its siblings'.
<!-- Project-specific / Go-Testing -->

### Go-Common Mistakes

- Catch-all package: a `util` or `common` package absorbing unrelated helpers => move each helper to the package named for its concept.
- Shared package state: package-level mutable state read or written from more than one goroutine => make it immutable, or give it one owning goroutine or a lock.
- Side-effecting `init()`: an `init()` reaching out to a database, file, or network => move the work into an explicit setup call; keep `init()` to registration.
- Stored context: a `context.Context` kept on a struct field => pass it as the first parameter of each call that needs it.
- String-compared error: an error matched by its formatted text => compare with `errors.Is` or extract with `errors.As`.
- Producer-side interface: a wide interface declared next to its one implementation => declare the small interface the consumer needs, at the consumer.
